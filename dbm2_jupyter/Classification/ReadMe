# Classification Problem:
Can we classify the round reached by a team that has qualified for the world cup?

Round-Classifier-Final.ipynb is the jupyter notebook containing a full description of our problem and solution.

new.csv is the csv file detailing each teams Country, GoalsFor/90min, GoalsAgainst/90min and GoalDifference/90min.
simple-new.csv is the same as new.csv however each statistic is rounded to the nearest 0.125.

Round-Classifier.joblib is the best model we trained on new.csv
Round-Classifier-Smoothed.joblib is the best model we trained on new-smoothed.csv

Round-Classiifer-Smoothed.dot is a visualisation of Round-Classifier-Smoothed.joblib
